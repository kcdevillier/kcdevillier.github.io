<p>This is a picture of a woodfired jar. Notice all the variation on the pot. This was all</p>

<p>The type of pottery I love is woodfired. This is an Anagama Kiln. It involves a firing process that's been going on for thousands of years. The signature results are the</p>
<p>complexities of the atmospheric glazes</p>
